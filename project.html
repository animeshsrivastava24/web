								<h4><b>Design Optimal FIR Filter and Filter Bank employing
Hybrid Combination of Gradient and Nature inspired optimization Techniques.</b></h4>
								<p> Recently, optimal multirate filter banks have wide
applications in digital signal processing applications (video signals, ECG signal
processing, beam forming antenna, detection of harmonics, denoising, subband
decomposition and recognition of one and two dimensional signals etc). Therefore,
optimal design of digital filter and filter bank are basic requirement of recent
generation of signal processing applications.<a href="projects/Dr Kuldeep Baderia Project Proposal.pdf">more</a></p>

								<h4><b>RAKTHPRO</b></h4>
								<p> A blood bank is a cache or bank of blood or blood components, gathered as a result of blood
donation or collection, stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion. The term "blood
bank" typically refers to a division of a hospital where the storage of blood product occurs and
where proper testing is performed.<a href="projects/Incubation-Anil.pdf">more</a></p>

								<h4><b>IoT Enabled Real-Time Aqua Guider</b></h4>
								<p>Aquaculture is the considered as secondary farming in India. As the second largest country in aquaculture production, the share of inland fisheries has 85 percent in total aqua production. But there are many problems challenging this sector. The major problem in aqua-farming is the sudden change of dissolved oxygen, Ph value, Ammonia level and minerals in water. <a href="projects/Project_IC-2.docx">more</a></p>

								<h4><b>To identify Entrepreneurial intention and Skills of Physically Disabled Students</b></h4>
								<p>In the long span of Indian independence since 1947 a lot of measures have been taken by the
different governments for the welfare of its citizens. However, it is unfortunate that till date
unemployment is a big concern. This concern has been discussed through a number of written
articles and discussions at many intellectual forums and it has been concluded that
entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial environment are the ways to reduce unemployment in the
country. <a href="projects/Project-Incubation.pdf">more</a></p>

								<h4><b>Effect of Trailing edge ramp on silt removal in Small Hydel Power Projects.</b></h4>
								<p>The idea of this comes from the problem lid driven cavity. In lid driven cavity problem we see that the cavity flow structures are produced. And when we tilt the ramp edge there occurs some changes in the flow structure and pressure drag. So this principle can be used to produce a shear force on the upper boundary.  <a href="projects/project proposal.docx">more</a></p>
