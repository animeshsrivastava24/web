								<h4><b>Electricity Generation through Railway Tracks</b></h4>
								<p>In this project generating electrical power by running train on the railway track. Non-conventional energy using railway track needs no fuel input power to generate the
output in the form of Electrical power. <a href="projects/Proposal for IRIC.pdf">more</a></p>

								<h4><b>Diffie-Hellmann Key Exchange with Elliptic Curves (ECC) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Based Security Framework for Internet of Things and Cloud Computing</b></h4>
								<p> The Internet of Things is integrating information systems, places, users and Billions of constrained devices into one global network. This network requires secure and private means of communications.. We present Diffie-Hellman key exchange with elliptic curves and AES Cryptosystems which address the security issues in the heterogeneous IoT networks. The security strengths of various public key cryptosystems are analysed and ensured ECC is one of the best cryptosystems for internet of things and cloud.<a href="projects/rpo edited.docx">more</a></p>

								<h4><b>Landslide susceptibility mapping along Highway corridors for roadside slope maintenance .</b></h4>
								<p> The main aim of the project is to prepare  a  landslide susceptibility map along roadside and using it for slope maintenance. ArcG1S can be used for this purpose. A landslide inventory will also be prepared  for validation of the results. The final out of the study  can be used by construction firms and transport planners.<a href="projects/sandeep panchal.docx">more</a></p>

								<h4><b>SMART PARKING SYSTEM</b></h4>
								<p>Among the challenges that we face in our day to day life one of most unavoidable challenge is parking the car wherever we go. As our need increases our travelling increases but due to drastic increase in usage of vehicles and increase in population we face the tough task of parking our car particularly during busiest hours of the day. <a href="projects/smart_parking_proposal.docx">more</a></p>

								<h4><b>Self Sustained Roof top rain water harvesting</b></h4>
								<p>The rainwater falling from the roof will trinkle down to a storage tank located below .Any dust particles, sentiments would be allowed to settle. In this tank there will be a mechanism through which water will release in the form of jet (with high velocity) on a turbine. This turbine will help in pumping water to the roof tank. <a href="projects/vs dogra sir.docx">more</a></p>

								<h4><b>Performance of Power Line Communication System</b></h4>
								<p>Power Line Communication (PLC) allows data transmission over
conductors and does not require extra infrastructure. Therefore, it is considered as a
retrofit technology [1]. Power lines not only serve as media for carrying power but are
also capable of carrying data for the purpose of communication. Recent developments
in telecommunication technologies make PLC one of the most suitable candidates for
serving as an independent communication network. <a href="projects/project_proposal (1).pdf">more</a></p>
